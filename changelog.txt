Since 5.1.3:

Bugs FIXED:
- Fixed block manager corruption
- Fixed regions to work 100% of the time
- Fixed some notifications not firing correctly
- Fix survival players being denied item frames if the server is not tracking them
- Fixed inventories not saving/loading correctly

Features ADDED:
- Added warning for SQL being used (Will be dropped in 5.3.0)
- Added option for cross-gamemode contamination
    - EXAMPLE: Survival dirt trying to place creative torch
    - EXAMPLE: Survival dirt has creative torch, when dirt broken in Survival, torch is broken as if in creative (disappears, no drop)
- Added ability to see ender chests, specific gamemodes, and specific world inventories with /as mirror. Required inventory handler to be in use
- Added ability to look up players with /as check
- Added cuboid code (use Slime Ball), this is how you make regions now
- Added protection for spawning of Golems (snow and iron) as well as the Wither
- Added auto-cleaning feature to configurations
- Added error-string to help with debugging / user errors
- Added /as version
- Added set block tool (left click=set, right=remove. Blaze Powder)
- Added /as toolbox

Features CHANGED:
- SQL is no longer used to SAVE. However, AntiShare will load off of it. 
    - AntiShare loads the first time off SQL, then when it saves it disables SQL to load off flat file
- The block manager now only loads what it needs (loaded chunks only, as chunks are unloaded the block manager saves those chunk's gamemode blocks to disk)
- Changed how tools are added to your inventory. They will now try to take the first slot by force (move items)
 
1.4 changes that need to be protected:
- Beacon powers need to be blocked (eg: if made by creative player, only creative is affected) [PR: CB-915]

TODO: 
- Inventory system could use a refresh (but it works!)
