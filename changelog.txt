Potential Features:
- Item Frames placed by "gm1" and put an item into it with "gm2" should be protected?

HOW PERMISSIONS WORK:

If there is an item involved, then AS checks as follows:

- Allowed to use item
- Denied item
- Allowed to use event
- Denied event
- Affect creative && creative mode
- Affect survival && survival mode
- Affect adventure && adventure mode

If no item:

- Allowed to use event
- Denied event
- Affect creative && creative mode
- Affect survival && survival mode
- Affect adventure && adventure mode

To apply permissions to attack a player/mob, use the entity/player name
To apply permissions to use a command, apply the permission AntiShare.(deny/allow).commands.plugin
    Eg: AntiShare.deny.commands.antishare denies use to /antishare (assuming creative mode & defaults)
