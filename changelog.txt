Since 5.1.3:
- Fixed block manager corruption
- Added warning for SQL being used (Will be dropped in 5.3.0)
- Added option for cross-gamemode contamination
    - EXAMPLE: Survival dirt trying to place creative torch
    - EXAMPLE: Survival dirt has creative torch, when dirt broken in Survival, torch is broken as if in creative (disappears, no drop)
- Allow /as mirror to use ender chests, offline players, specific game modes, and specific worlds
- /as check can now look up players with /as check <player>
- Updated regions to be more reliable (complete system rewrite)
- Added own code for selecting regions (Use Slimeball)
- Update tool logic
- SQL is no longer used to save to. Instead, SQL is used to load and ONLY load.
- Allow protection of mob spawning (golems / wither)
- Minor bug fixes:
    - Crafting notification not being shown
- Added auto-cleaning feature to startup. This removes old keys from the configuration files
- Fix survival players being denied item frames if the server is not tracking them
- Fixed inventories not loading/saving correctly
- Added error-string to identify versions easier in config.yml
 
1.4 changes that need to be protected:
- Beacon powers need to be blocked (eg: if made by creative player, only creative is affected) [PR: CB-915]

TODO: 
- Block manager needs "active chunk" loading/saving system (cause why load everything when you only need 1/10th?)
- Inventory system could use a refresh (but it works!)
