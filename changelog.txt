Since 5.0.2:
- Change events to use debug mode
 
1.4 changes that need to be protected:
- Beacon powers need to be blocked (eg: if made by creative player, only creative is affected) [PR: CB-915]

Potential Features:
- Entities (like minecarts) should be blocked from breaking if in the block-break (or new?) list
- Item Frames placed by "gm1" and put an item into it with "gm2" should be protected?
- Determine if "hs pid errors" are at source of AntiShare (unlikely)
