<h1>Cannot handle misc. inventory</h1>
<p><b>This is a critical problem and should be reported to turt2live immediatly (email: turt2live@turt2live.com).</b> This error is produced when AntiShare cannot deal with an inventory. A 'misc inventory' is an inventory created by AntiShare but has no code to produce it in a 'custom' way.</p>
<h3>How do I fix this?</h3>
<p><u>You must contact turt2live to get this error fixed. It is STRONGLY encouraged you do so.</u></p>
