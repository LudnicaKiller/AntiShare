<h1>AntiShare</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Log Analyzer! This application allows you to open an AntiShare log and figure out what AntiShare, or your players, are doing.</p>
<p>
	There are 4 types of logs, all of which are explained in a little bit. Each log has a slightly different function and helps you narrow down parts of AntiShare with ease.<br>
	The 4 log files are as follows: <br>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>antishare-log.txt</b> 
				- This file contains "technical" information about AntiShare, such as conflicts, startup, shutdown, errors, and general information. Most of the time you will not need to use this log as it doesn't supply much more information than your server.log could.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>events-log.txt</b> 
				- This file simply contains all the notifications fired by AntiShare. <i>What is a notification</i> you ask? A notification is a message sent by AntiShare to the people with the right permissions that someone did something illegal, or legal, within the game, this may be a broken block or an attempt to light a house on fire.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>log.txt</b> 
				- At the moment, this has the exact same function as events-log.txt.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>log-all.txt</b> 
				- This is just like events-log.txt but shows EVERYTHING that happened instead of being limited to whatever you have set in the config.yml. This could be useful if you wanted to know if someone has been breaking legal blocks, but of a specific type, without being spammed in game because you would have to change your settings.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<h2>How can I disable logs?</h2>
<p>You cannot disable all logs (as some are required if you come accross a bad enough bug), but you can disable the event logs by simply turning off notifications in the config.yml</p>
<h2>What else can I do in this application?</h2>
<p>Sadly at the moment there is nothing else you can do. Although eventually support for a graphical configuration, permissions setup, general help, bug reporting, and more may be added.</p>
