# This allows you to specify fines for illegal events. You can also 
# specify rewards for such actions.
# 
# 'no-money' is the value to charge if the player has zero as a balance.
# This can be set as 'default' if you don't want it to vary from the fine.
# 
# 'keep-tab' if set to true, AntiShare will track who owes what money
# and remove it when it can. If false, AntiShare will disregard the fine
# and pretend it never happened.
# 
# fines-enabled and rewards-enabled overrides the individul do-fine/reward
# settings in the actions.
# 
# 'show-status-on-login' - If true, and the player has chosen to silence
# the fine/reward messages, they will be told about this upon logging in.
# 
# 'give-to' - Valid options: creative, survival, both (meaning survival and creative), all, none
# 
# 'send-collections-to' - Any money gatherered from fines goes to an account with this name
# 'get-collections-from' - Any money needed for rewards comes from here
# Both of the above can be set to "nowhere" if this feature is to be disabled
# 
# Permissions:
# AntiShare.money.nofine = Never fine the player
# AntiShare.money.noreward = Never reward the player
# AntiShare.money.* = Never reward or fine the player (Default OP)
# 
# Note: player-death is applied per event, NOT per item!
