# World Split Configuration
# 
# Use the following template to create a world split:
# 
# worldname:
#     axis: 
#     value: 
#     positive: 
#     negative: 
#     warn:
#         use: 
#         distance: 
# 
# Here is the above example filled out:
# 
# world1:
#     axis: X
#     value: 245
#     positive: creative
#     negative: survival
#     warn:
#         use: true 
#         distance: 15
# 
# The above example says that in "world1" there is a split on the X-axis (the only other
# option is the Z-axis) at the value 245. Anything ABOVE 245 (>=246) will be the "creative"
# side while anything less than 245 (<=245) will be the "survival" side. This example also
# uses the warning function. This means that as the player approaches the split axis they 
# can be warned of such. This example says "warn them when they are 15 blocks away".
